# ðŸ§© Elements

**At its heart, this project is all about** [people.md](../goals/people.md "mention") **and** [education.md](../goals/education.md "mention")**.**

Why those two and not, say, [data](data/ "mention")? A couple of reasons:

1. First, we know from research and our own experience that data is a tool used by people for outcomes; building this project only on data would miss the opportunity space offered by the adjacent possible that people discover by asking critical questions.
2. Second, we believe that a mindset shift toward learning will enable a culture of innovation (our mission) in ways that simply having more data or information will not.&#x20;

When starting out, we recalled all the frustrations many of us experienced in our daily work (especially government employees) and determined that it would not suffice to let a particular visualization tool drive applications.

You may not _think_ you care about the data (though you _should_), but we want to be clear that this is where we start: people and data.

What you probably _do_ care about, especially if you're reading this page, is **how you can use the project**. To that end, please continue reading to learn more about its core features and future development we are considering, or skip ahead to [use-cases](../use-cases/ "mention") to see our hypotheses about how someone like you might benefit.

* [data](data/ "mention"): What powers the project.
* [graph.md](graph.md "mention"): How the project data is connected.
* [map.md](map.md "mention"): Where to find the project in your neighborhood.
* [timeline.md](timeline.md "mention"): How the project data shows evolution over time.
