{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**: While we are experimenting with [kumu.md](../../learning/tools/kumu.md "mention") during the [alpha](../../release-notes/alpha/ "mention") and [beta.md](../../release-notes/beta.md "mention") stages of this project, the link to the `Graph` is likely to change (a result of how [kumu.md](../../learning/tools/kumu.md "mention") links are structured). We will keep this page linked as those changes occur, so if you get an error going to an old link, please come back here.
{% endhint %}

The [data](data/ "mention") in this project is great, and we are really excited to build it more and more, but what started it all was this idea about a network graph showing `Organizations` in the ecosystem.

We want to build on that idea to incorporate other [entities.md](data/entities.md "mention") (like `Groups`, `Activities`, `Artifacts`, and even `Individuals`), but there are a lot of associated [data](data/ "mention") challenges there, so we started with [google-sheets.md](../../learning/tools/google-sheets.md "mention") and [kumu.md](../../learning/tools/kumu.md "mention") and will continue exploring with [partners.md](../support/partners.md "mention") to see what else might be helpful and more robust.

### Initial Graph

We populated the [alpha](../../release-notes/alpha/ "mention") with just `Government` `Organizations` and are building from there, trying to capture the right layers while also finding views that simplify the complexity.&#x20;

This will be most of the fun of this project (isn't [data-visualization.md](../../learning/concepts/data-visualization.md "mention") always fun?) and we look forward to [feedback.md](../feedback.md "mention"), so feel free to [contact-us.md](../contact-us.md "mention")!

### Future Graphs

As we think about the future, we want to expand to include the [map.md](map.md "mention") and [timeline.md](timeline.md "mention") (both of which can be uniuque or just different views of the same [data](data/ "mention")) - we don't know the right answer yet on how to do this, and expect that working with [partners.md](../support/partners.md "mention") will likely open up other avenues for [data-visualization.md](../../learning/concepts/data-visualization.md "mention") that we may want to explore.
