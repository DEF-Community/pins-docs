# üîÅ Iteration

In starting this project we knew a few things and hypothesized about many others. We also realized that all of those ideas, assumptions, and hypotheses might be completely wrong (e.g. the [use-cases](../use-cases/ "mention") we set out) and know the only potential outcomes from that reality are:

1. Allow the project to fail by locking ourselves into something with no [feedback.md](../feedback.md "mention");&#x20;
2. Start slowly with something that can be changed and then add features or tweaks over time.

We are taking the latter approach, which will be an iterative process of rolling out different [elements](../elements/ "mention") of the project over time (see [feature-timeline.md](../../release-notes/feature-timeline.md "mention")) and then engaging [contributors.md](../support/contributors.md "mention") through the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") process to ensure we are sustainable.
