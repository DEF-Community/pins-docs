# 🏫 Academic

{% hint style="warning" %}
While we are in the [alpha](../../release-notes/alpha/ "mention") and early [beta.md](../../release-notes/beta.md "mention") stages of this project we expect [.](./ "mention") to be pretty flexible and welcome [feedback.md](../feedback.md "mention") to tweak them.
{% endhint %}

Many may be familiar with the role of academia in national security innovation by virtue of `Entities` like `University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs)` or some sort of `National Security Innovation Network (NSIN)` activity with `Hacking for Defense (H4D)` or the like.

> **Our hypothesis is that** [academic.md](academic.md "mention") **** [entities.md](../elements/data/entities.md "mention") **will be interested in trends for research, use material as part of a course on national security or innovation, and maybe even partner with the project for mutually beneficial outcomes.**

In this vein we hope to add value by offering something unique and curious to poke and prod for study purposes, but also know that the breadth of expertise latent in educational contexts would be a wonderfully symbiotic component of continued project development.
