# ❤ Non-Profit

{% hint style="warning" %}
While we are in the [alpha](../../release-notes/alpha/ "mention") and early [beta.md](../../release-notes/beta.md "mention") stages of this project we expect [.](./ "mention") to be pretty flexible and welcome [feedback.md](../feedback.md "mention") to tweak them.
{% endhint %}

As volunteers in such organizations ourselves, we know the value of [non-profit.md](non-profit.md "mention") [entities.md](../elements/data/entities.md "mention") to national security innovation and are excited to engage them through this project.

> **We believe** [non-profit.md](non-profit.md "mention") **orgs will benefit by connecting with** [government.md](government.md "mention") **and other non-profits that have a similar mission or find new teammates for projects.**

There's certainly the [education.md](../goals/education.md "mention") aspect around [data](../elements/data/ "mention") as well, which we hope will be the tide that raises all boats, but at least to start there's this idea around connectivity.
