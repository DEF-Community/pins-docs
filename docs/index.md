# Project Overview

!!! note

    **Welcome!** :wave: **Thanks for your interest in national security and innovation.** This site documents our efforts for this project so that you can understand and engage with it.

    This project is now in the public [beta.md](release-notes/beta.md "mention") phase, which means everything is live and we're picking up speed. Your thoughts and ideas are welcome either at hello@def.org or in the feedback form on NationalSecurityInnovation.org. :pray:

### Structure of Docs

There are a number of sections you can access to learn more about the project - each section has an overview page just like this one to further explain what you can find there, and you can also use the `Search` feature or sidebar to navigate around:

* [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") (where you currently are) explains the basics of this project and associated features.
* The [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section does just what you might expect: identifies and answers common questions we receive about the project.
* [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") are the updates we make to the project over time so you can understand where changes take place (and also planned features).
* We use the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section to document step-by-step instructions and tutorials for each segment of the project to increase sustainability by making it easy to contribute.
* Lastly, [education.md](about/goals/education.md "mention") captures key elements underpinning the project, some of which are referenced elsewhere as foundational - great references.

### Navigation

There are a few different ways to navigate this guide:

* Use the `Sidebar` to scroll through and expand different sections
* Click on `Links` to different sections in order to hop right there
* Type something into `Search` and check out the results
