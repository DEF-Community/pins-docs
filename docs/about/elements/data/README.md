# 💻 Data

!!! info
	If you are curious about our reasoning behind the certain aspects of the **`Data`**, check out our [what-criteria-do-you-use-to-collect-project-data.md](../../../frequently-asked-questions/what-criteria-do-you-use-to-collect-project-data.md "mention") page in the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section.


The baseline product of this project is data, sourced from individuals like you, which feeds the [graph.md](../graph.md "mention"), [map.md](../map.md "mention"), and [timeline.md](../timeline.md "mention") (along with any future efforts or forks).

### Initial Data Set

We wanted to start simply, so we took a play from all the existing efforts or maps we could find and dumped everything into [google-sheets.md](../../../learning/tools/google-sheets.md "mention") to get started:

<details>

<summary><code>Data</code></summary>

****:link: **** [**Data - Project on Innovation in National Security (Google Sheets)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dj9LztlbBCB7BPCNpTHd8ko\_Uz1pcLQDjTOfEYJH6Ik/edit#gid=1534616606) ****&#x20;

Click the above link to open [google-sheets.md](../../../learning/tools/google-sheets.md "mention") and view the `Data` - the first page will be a `README` and then you can view other sheets with different [..](../ "mention").

</details>

You will notice (after opening the `Data`) that there are tabs on the bottom to explore [entities.md](entities.md "mention") and [connections.md](connections.md "mention") - feel free and do that while checking out the [graph.md](../graph.md "mention") to get a sense of how it works (HINT: it's not that complicated).

### Future Data Sets

We know that Google Sheets is going to start running into issues when we start working with a lot more data and types of [entities.md](entities.md "mention") (not to mention addressing the [dimensionality.md](../../../learning/concepts/dimensionality.md "mention") problems and figuring out [tags.md](tags.md "mention")).&#x20;

We have some [partners.md](../../support/partners.md "mention") in mind to try and help with this, but, for now, we are just hoping to give a little bit of a sense for how data is structured and then move forward with better infrastructure and tools as we go.

If you have ideas or questions, but all means, [contact-us.md](../../contact-us.md "mention")!&#x20;
