# Connections

We have a few different types of `Connections` that help characterize [entities.md](entities.md "mention") in the [graph.md](../graph.md "mention").

!!! info
	[connections.md](connections.md "mention") **and** [entities.md](entities.md "mention") **are the two foundational building blocks of the** [.](./ "mention").


## Links

We are currently exploring these `Connections` and may add others. As with `Tags`, there is a lot to debate and try to understand, so we welcome [feedback.md](../../feedback.md "mention"). In the `Data`, these types of `Connections` are called `Links` to differentiate from actual `Connections` between `Entities`.

### Org Chart

!!! success
	An **`Org Chart`** connection links parent and child in an organizational hierarchy.&#x20;


Almost all of the existing maps look at this dimension, which is important, especially for `Government` `Organizations` (which are subject to the views of their parent organizations and leadership, not to mention funding).

> **EXAMPLE**: The `Defense Innovation Unit` has an `Org Chart` `Connection` to the `Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E))`, which is its parent in the organizational chart.

### Collaboration

!!! success
	To be in **`Collaboration`** is to have mutually-supportive shared efforts, which could link any number of **`Entities`**.


While somewhat flexible (and, thus, subject to change or redifinition) we wanted to include this type of connection in order to demonstrate ties that we know exist and make a difference.

> **EXAMPLE**: `Platform One` `Collaborates` with `Black Pearl` even though the prior is an `Air Force` `Organization` and the latter is a `Navy` `Organization`.

### Funding

!!! success
	**`Funding`** identifies a connection between an **`Individual`** or **`Organization`** and another **`Organization`**, **`Group`**, or **`Activity`**..


This type is useful for understanding non-`Org Chart` `Connections` that many might be familiar with, but not fully understand.

> **EXAMPLE**: The `Defense Innovation Unit` has a `Funding` connection to `Saildrone`, a `Commercial` `Organization`.

### Research

!!! success
	The **`Research`** link connects an **`Individual`** or **`Organization`** to an **`Organization`**, **`Group`**, or **`Activity`**.


As the name suggests, this .

> **EXAMPLE**: `RAND` has `Research` links to the `US Army` and `US Air Force`.

### Member

!!! success
	A **`Member`** **`Connection`** links **`Entities`** through participation in a membership function.


This link type is useful for understanding non-`Org Chart` `Connections` that many might be familiar with, but not fully understand. As with [#contributor](connections.md#contributor "mention"), it is unlikely to be receive [verification.md](verification.md "mention"), but may be helpful for some working on their own `Graph` views.

> **EXAMPLE**: The `Air Force` is a `Member` of the `Joint Chiefs of Staff`.

### Contributor

!!! success
	**`Contributor`** links connect an **`Individual`** to another type of **`Entity`**, such as a **`Group`**, **`Activity`**, or **`Repository`**.


One of the more prolific types of `Individual` links, `Contributor` allows for flexibility between `Entities`, opening up a number of different `Graph` opportunities.

> **EXAMPLE**: As an `Author`,  `Jay Long` is also a `Contributor` to the `Modern War Institute`, an `Organization` that maintains a `Repository`.

!!! warning
	_**NOTE**: The most likely source of a_ **`Contributor`** _link will be from the_ **`Individual`** _in question themselves. As such, it is unlikely, even for public_  **`Graph`** _views, that such links will receive_ [verification.md](verification.md "mention")_, if nothing else due to quantity._&#x20;


### Author

!!! success
	The **`Author`** link connects an **`Individual`** with an **`Artifact`**.


Writing is an important part of national security innovation, with ideas penned by some spawning `Activities` generated by others. This link type, similar to [#founder](connections.md#founder "mention")and [#contributor](connections.md#contributor "mention"), is best suited for evaluating the graph of an `Individual`.

> **EXAMPLE**: Writers `August Cole` and `P.W. Singer` each have an `Author` link to the book `Ghost Fleet`, an `Artifact`.

### Founder

!!! success
	A **`Founder`** link ties an **`Individual`** to an **`Organization`**, **`Group`**, or **`Activity`**.


This link is best suited for understanding the impact of `Individuals` on the broader national security innovation ecosystem, in concert with the [#contributor](connections.md#contributor "mention") link.

> **EXAMPLE**: `Enrique Oti` has a `Founder` connection to `Kessel Run`.

!!! warning
	_**NOTE**: The goal of the_ **`Founder`** _connection is to show a specific type of_ **`Contributor`**, but may be applied more broadly than to only a couple of **`Individuals`**, depending on the situation. We are also sensitive to "serial fake founders" that seek inappropriate credit and may remove this link type if it proves problematic, as with any link type.


### DEF Community

!!! success
	The **`DEF Community`** link connects **`Entities`** in a specific configuration for graph visualizations.&#x20;


This is DEF specific, helping create graph views that summarize the ways DEF links different national security elements as a way of illustrating its value and potential to the community, or opening opportunities for discussion.&#x20;

It is likely to change over time.

> **EXAMPLE**: In one `Graph` view, the `Air Force` has a `DEF Community` link to the `Defense Entrepreneurs Forum` and another `DEF Community` link to `AFWERX`.
