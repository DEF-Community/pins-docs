# 🏛 Government

!!! warning
	While we are in the [alpha](../../release-notes/alpha/ "mention") and early [beta.md](../../release-notes/beta.md "mention") stages of this project we expect [.](./ "mention") to be pretty flexible and welcome [feedback.md](../feedback.md "mention") to tweak them.


Our hypothesis around the utility of this project for government use is largely about awareness and connectivity, but could also be linked with [education.md](../goals/education.md "mention").

> **We believe** [government.md](government.md "mention") **users will benefit by knowing who else is in the ecosystem in order to build connections, learn faster, and work more efficiently. We think they will learn about data as well, which is a win.**

In practice, we know how difficult it is for government people to connect with other government people - it's silly, but also very real! Getting beyond one's own silo is hard, and we believe this project can help people do just that.

Adding to the mix a streamlined way to dip into the data game without getting overwhelmed and we have a recipe for some really wonderful collaboration.
