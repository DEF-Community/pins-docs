# v0.1.0

This initial version started with the work of several existing efforts, incuding the [2018 version of a similar project](https://kumu.io/aflazo/def-innovation-ecosystem-map#def-ecosystem-map) and data accumulated through crowdsourcing and research conducted by interns at both [FIS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/federal-innovators-salon/) and [DEF](https://www.def.org).&#x20;

**Many thanks to all those who dedicated their time and effort to provide a robust baseline!** :pray:

Our overall goal in starting out was simply to learn the best ways to reliably and consistently ingest `Data` and display it in the `Graph` - these two tasks form the main functionality of the project and enabling extensibility (e.g. multiple means of [adding-or-updating-data.md](../../workflow/contribution/adding-or-updating-data.md "mention") and multiple means of [cleaning-data.md](../../workflow/evaluation/cleaning-data.md "mention") are foundational to what we're looking at.

=== "Data"
    * Exported existing lists from various sources and started consolidating them in [google-sheets.md](../../learning/tools/google-sheets.md "mention") to serve as an initial public view of `Data` outside a visualization tool
    * Established initial [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention") list with associated fields based on existing lists noted above (see the `Labels` column in `Entities` sheet)
    * Created initial [categories.md](../../about/elements/data/categories.md "mention") for use with [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention") (see the `Validation (ignore)` sheet)
    * Built initial list of [tags.md](../../about/elements/data/tags.md "mention") to use with [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention") (see the `Validation (ignore)` sheet)
    * Wrote initial [connections.md](../../about/elements/data/connections.md "mention") by type to link [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention") (see the `Validation (ignore)` sheet)

=== "Graph"

    * Connectied [google-sheets.md](../../learning/tools/google-sheets.md "mention") to [kumu.md](../../learning/tools/kumu.md "mention") to see how the [graph.md](../../about/elements/graph.md "mention") data import worked.
    * Experimented with different [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention"), [categories.md](../../about/elements/data/categories.md "mention"), [tags.md](../../about/elements/data/tags.md "mention"), and [connections.md](../../about/elements/data/connections.md "mention") to see how they look in the [graph.md](../../about/elements/graph.md "mention").

=== "Timeline"
    * No `Timeline` features were modified in this release.
    * While we are currently using [kumu.md](../../learning/tools/kumu.md "mention") for visualization and it offers the ability to snap efforts to a `Timeline`, our first `Graph` will focus primarily on connections to show where innovation-focused efforts are housed.

=== "Map"

    * No `Map` features were modified in this release.
    * As with the `Timeline` we have the capability to display certain `Entities` in a `Map` view and are excited to add that functionality as we learn about the best ways to work with the `Data` and `Graph`.
