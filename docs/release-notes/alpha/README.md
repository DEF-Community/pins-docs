# ðŸ¥š Alpha

Our Alpha started in December 2021 with the initial goal of scoping the four [elements](../../about/elements/ "mention") and the instantiating the first two:&#x20;

* [data](../../about/elements/data/ "mention")
* [graph.md](../../about/elements/graph.md "mention")

The other two will be addressed either in the [beta.md](../beta.md "mention") or some other future release cycle.

Some of our tasks pursuant to these are listed below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Data" %}
* [x] Identify existing data sources or maps
* [ ] Compile all `Government` `Organization` [entities.md](../../about/elements/data/entities.md "mention") from existing data sources
* [ ] Add additional `Government` `Organizations` required to make `Org Chart` [connections.md](../../about/elements/data/connections.md "mention")
* [ ] Make all relevant [connections.md](../../about/elements/data/connections.md "mention") between `Government` `Organizations`
